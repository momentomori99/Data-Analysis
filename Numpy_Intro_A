Numpy - numerical computing processing tool, just to process numbers

Remember that computers can only
process 1s and 0s. Binary machine.

The RAM stores the data that is being currently processed.
For example if RAM is 8GB, it means that can process 8GB of bits at the same time.

We often wish to use least amount of memory, so that we could process more.
